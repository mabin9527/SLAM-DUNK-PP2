The purpose for doing this site was motivated by Slam-Dunk film coming back next year after 20 years. The Slam Dunk cartoon has a profound impression on our generation. In memory of younger time, there are serveral classic Slam-Dunk songs collected to build this site. The live site can be found [here](https://mabin9527.github.io/SLAM-DUNK-PP2/).

# Design

**Text & Background color**

To give my white Rock, Paper, Scissors buttons with their white circles a nice contrast, I decided to go with a teal colour. The text color is black, and it works well together with teal. It has been checked with a Contrast Checker (see testing section).
